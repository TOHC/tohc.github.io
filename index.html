                                <p>Every two days now we create as much information as we did from the dawn of civilization up until 2003, according to Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Data science is an up-and-coming discipline that's all about analyzing and bringing structure to large amounts of incoherent data. The demand for data scientists is increasing rapidly. It is predicted that by 2018, there will be a 50 percent gap in the supply of data scientists versus demand. DataHacks is an event devoted to the wonders of data science and artificial intelligence. Students will get the opportunity to learn advanced concepts in the fields of data mining and machine learning all for free! The event will consist of snacks, numerous hands-on workshops, and a team competition. There are no prerequisites and beginners are welcome!</p>
